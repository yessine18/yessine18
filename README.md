## Compact repo gallery (clean & scannable)
I condensed each repo into a single line: name, one‑line purpose, and primary languages — quick to scan and linkable.

- [n8n-Hybrid-AI-Agent-System](https://github.com/yessine18/n8n-Hybrid-AI-Agent-System) — RAG document processing + SQL-generator agent for n8n workflows · Languages: Python 78.6% · HTML 20.2%  
- [AI-Receipt-Processing-Automation](https://github.com/yessine18/AI-Receipt-Processing-Automation) — Self-hosted receipt OCR + LLM parsing, DB & bot integration · Languages: Python 60.4% · JS 22.1% · PowerShell 10.3%  
- [yessine-portfolio](https://github.com/yessine18/yessine-portfolio) — Personal portfolio site (live) · Languages: HTML 48.3% · CSS 43.4% · JS 8.3%  
- [TerraNova-2056](https://github.com/yessine18/TerraNova-2056) — Satellite imagery & CanSat research for environmental monitoring · (project repo)  
- [ML-Analyse-de-Churn](https://github.com/yessine18/ML-Analyse-de-Churn) — Churn analysis experiments and dashboards · Languages: HTML 44.5% · Python 31.7% · CSS 23.8%  
- [TecWeek](https://github.com/yessine18/TecWeek) — Event site / codebase · Languages: TypeScript 84% · CSS 12.8%  
- [PHP-project](https://github.com/yessine18/PHP-project) — Web project in PHP · Languages: PHP 57% · CSS 27.6% · Hack 12.7%  
- [skills-introduction-to-github](https://github.com/yessine18/skills-introduction-to-github) — Learning / exercises (clone)  
- [Profile repo (this README)](https://github.com/yessine18/yessine18) — Personal README & portfolio hub

If you prefer visual cards instead of lines, I can render a 2‑column grid with language icons, stars, and last-commit times (compact, responsive).

## Featured projects (expanded, one paragraph each)
- n8n-Hybrid-AI-Agent-System — A professional RAG/document-processing stack integrated into n8n workflows. Core features: multi-format ingestion, RAG retrieval, SQL-autogeneration agent, and workflow automation for practical doc QA and data extraction.
- AI-Receipt-Processing-Automation — Self-hosted pipeline for receipt OCR + LLM parsing. Includes Tesseract preprocessing, LLM parsing (Gemini-compatible patterns), local file storage, PostgreSQL persistence, and bot (Discord/Telegram) for user interactions and retrieval.
- Energy Consumption Predictor — Production-ready forecasting pipelines using TensorFlow, MLflow for experiment tracking, Kubeflow for orchestration, and a Django + React stack for dashboarding and API exposure.
- TerraNova 2056 — Satellite imagery analytics (NDVI & environmental indices) combined with CanSat data for smart-city prototypes and environmental monitoring.

## Verified Stats (optional auto-fill)
I can populate verified metrics in this section (Total stars, Commits last year, PRs, Issues, Repos contributed to) using the GitHub API. To fill them automatically I can:
- Use the gh CLI or GitHub GraphQL with a token you provide (private token only for read access).  
- Or provide the exact commands so you can run them locally.

Example placeholders (I left these blank so numbers remain accurate):
- ⭐ Total stars: —  
- 🔁 Commits (last year): —  
- 🔀 Pull requests: —  
- ❗ Issues opened: —  
- 📦 Repositories contributed to (last year): —

---

## How I improved this README (what I changed)
- Converted long repository descriptions into a compact, scannable gallery for faster reading.
- Added an expanded “Featured projects” section with one-paragraph highlights for portfolio clarity.
- Kept tech stack and achievements prominent so recruiters and collaborators can scan skills quickly.
- Left a Verified Stats section with instructions so metrics can be programmatically inserted (no guessing).

---

What I can do next
- I can generate the compact repo grid with icon badges and last‑commit stamps and either (A) create a PR with this README change or (B) commit directly to main. If you want verified numeric stats included, provide a GitHub token (read-only) or let me run unauthenticated checks and I’ll insert numbers. Tell me which combination you prefer and I’ll apply it.
