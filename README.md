## How this README is accurate
- I used the repository names, descriptions, and language composition details you shared to build the “Repositories snapshot” and update the Featured Projects list to reflect the actual public projects you maintain.
- I intentionally kept descriptions minimal where you didn’t supply a description — this ensures accuracy and avoids assumptions.

If you want, I can:
- Pull README summaries directly from each repo and expand the "Repositories snapshot" with one‑line project summaries (automated).  
- Commit this README update to the profile repo for you (I can create a commit and push a branch + PR or update main directly — say which workflow you prefer).  
- Add direct links to each repo in the featured projects and snapshot.

What I did: I reviewed the profile README you had and the repository metadata you provided, consolidated the information into a clear profile README draft that reflects the actual repos and languages, and prepared a structured README that is ready to commit.

What's next: tell me whether you want me to (A) automatically fetch README summaries from each repo and enrich the file, or (B) commit this draft to the profile repo as-is (and whether to push directly to main or open a pull request). Once you choose, I will proceed and perform the requested repo operation.
